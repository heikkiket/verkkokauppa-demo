# A small webshop

This is a small demo webshop. It uses following technologies:

 * MariaDB
 * CakePHP 3.7
 * Vue.js 2.6.10
 * Foundation 6
 
 You have to log in in order to add products to a cart. I had plans to add
 support for anonymous user, but didn't learn enough about
 how to do that in CakePHP.
 
 It also involves a small admin utility that lets you add more products to
 your shop.
 
 Not much to say about this...
